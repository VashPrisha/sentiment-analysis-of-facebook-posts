Many of today's leading companies, such as Facebook, Google, and Uber, make machine learning a central part of their operations. Machine learning has become a significant competitive differentiator for many companies.\\n\\nMachine learning has several practical applications that drive the kind of real business results - such as time and money savings - that have the potential to dramatically impact the future of your organization. In particular, we see tremendous impact occurring within the customer care industry, whereby machine learning is allowing people to get things done more quickly and efficiently. Through Virtual Assistant solutions, machine learning automates tasks that would otherwise need to be performed by a live agent - such as changing a password or checking an account balance. This frees up valuable agent time that can be used to focus on the kind of customer care that humans perform best: high touch, complicated decision-making that is not as easily handled by a machine. At Interactions, we further improve the process by eliminating the decision of whether a request should be sent to a human or a machine: unique Adaptive Understanding technology, the machine learns to be aware of its limitations, and bailout to humans when it has low confidence in providing the correct solution.\", 'created_time': '2024-06-18T09:55:54+0000', 'id': '368954602960988_122097858152371915', 'comments': {'data': [], 'summary': {'order': 'chronological', 'total_count': 0, 'can_comment': True}}}], 'paging': {'cursors': {'before': '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', 'after': 'QVFIUlZAibE5TZADcyVFlPSDVFa1FrYUhOWGJubDdDT1ZAveTFpQWJnNVdPX2FUNlhoZA3FZAeFpCXzk2amtXbnFTN0RieHhyQTQwc3NFMndRamJCSXZAOdUZADQVNzYXluTmJsZAzQ1SkFaWFFvbDNsQXBlcERIZAURwTEJfQXB3dm42RnFaNDNYX1BmaXFRX1BHMXpadXYyZAjA2NUhVOFM3R19FdURNNUp2NEUzdkJHZAjJyZAWltS0hPcW5wZAElwaTAtbi16bGNPam5fbUdXVDRPeE1LNkM0OFJ0R2ZAVQ3VWYmM0OVZAac2I4MEg1bXZAoaFZAqbVVsdHhNNW1YUWNQeUpGNkR1RURwajlHOTJvS2RQQkJtX1Q0Q3cycXNxQVlGNHpMbXZAXVkg5QnZAKSW40SkdWMndmYVdjZA3hyVXE5VlRFTW14c2w5UG1XV1pDdWNYZAHNxRzNCSVdPRkdRUTNlNWlBM1VPaVNOTVlkbVZAsS1BIWmNNRUp2S3hZAY3RMNkx6WmhFYl94aTVsV0g5Y3R1bUZAmVGNXcVhqSXJmczNSaXZAUaDBtNjVmZA2tLeWE4NXYzUlNoOVEZD'}}}\n"
